        <h2>The Villains</h2>
        <p>
            Suguro Geto is one of the few Jutsu Sorcerers that have earned the respect of Satoru Gojo. His cursed technique allows him to control cursed spirits, but the extent of his power has yet to be demonstrated on screen.

It could very well be the case that Suguro is the man behind each of the unregistered special grade cursed spirit's actions. The fact that this sorcerer is powerful enough to barter with these special-grade curses is impressive. If it is revealed that he has been controlling them, Suguro may be on an entirely different level than viewers first assumed.
